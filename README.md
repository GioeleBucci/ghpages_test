# What is this repo

These are my solutions for [an OOP lab exercise](https://github.com/unibo-oop/lab07/tree/exercises/72-anonymous-nested-enum).
Thanks to github actions whenever this repo gets updated the javadoc documentation is fetched and uploaded [on this website](https://gioelebucci.github.io/ghpages_test/), hosted on Github Pages.
